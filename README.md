## About the Project

*The repository has a sandbox character: It is not 'finished' work, but rather 'work-in-progress'.*

This repository contains many files with transcriptions from original sources and some code to process and analyse these transcriptions. It also includes drafts and final versions of my presentations, papers, articles and the books I am working on regarding this project. Please handle it with care!

The repository now contains the files for [the book I published](http://diglib.hab.de/ebooks/ed000738/start.htm) with [the Herzog August Library](http://www.hab.de/) in Wolfenb√ºttel in late 2017. They are mainly MS Word files (.doc and .docx) - not sure how useful they are. And not using a sensible versioning control systen, they look a bit messy. I am unsure if I will do something about that or leave the files as they are. I will only update the publication's source file (.xml). I plan to submit version 1.1 with some updates on new finds and some minor corrections (typos etc.) and a couple of new links, mainly to the four digital editions I submitted in spring to the [Deutsches Textarchiv](http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/) for archiving and publication.

I will also upload my other material for the *Ethica* project, containing .xml-files and the usual .doc and .docx. I will write plain text in a text editor instead of a word processor for future purposes. Edition files will be in .xml. I am also considering publishing parts of the edition as a (printed) book and want to use LaTeX for that. I have yet to decide, though.

Furthermore, I still toy with developing a description set for physical bibliography within the TEI framework. As far as I can see, the work in the working group on physical bibliography was discontinued some years ago, and I have yet to have the time to contribute much. I can revisit some of the ideas from back then that could be the basis for a formal proposal to TEI.
